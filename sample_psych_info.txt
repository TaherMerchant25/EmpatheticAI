Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people learn how to identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on behavior and emotions. CBT focuses on changing the automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen emotional difficulties, depression, and anxiety. These spontaneous negative thoughts have a detrimental influence on mood. Through CBT, these thoughts are identified, challenged, and replaced with more objective, realistic thoughts.

Key concepts in CBT:
1.  Faulty thinking patterns contribute to psychological problems.
2.  Learned patterns of unhelpful behavior contribute to these problems.
3.  People can learn more helpful ways of coping, thereby relieving their symptoms.

Techniques often involve journaling, role-playing, relaxation techniques, and mental distractions. It's often used for depression, anxiety disorders, phobias, PTSD, and eating disorders.

Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment non-judgmentally. It can be practiced through meditation or by simply bringing awareness to everyday activities. Mindfulness can help reduce stress, improve emotional regulation, and increase self-awareness. It is often integrated into therapies like MBCT (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy) and DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy). Regular practice can lead to greater feelings of calm and acceptance.

It is important to remember that therapy is a collaborative process between the therapist and the client. Finding the right therapist and approach is key. Always consult with a qualified professional for diagnosis and treatment. Online resources can be informative but cannot replace professional evaluation.
